Hello there! My name is Daniel Martinez Amigo and I'm a computer systems engineering graduate from the University of Bath. While my degree covered a wide range of subjects in both computer science and electrical engineering, I am mainly interested in computer graphics, low level programming, parallel computing and game development.

Takj about interest withiun graphics. atlk about software renderer project. 

Outside of graphics and engineering I like film, tv, anime and games (I am a big Destiny fan). On my spare time I ocassionally play piano as a hobby, mainly enjoying playing covers from tv series or other music I like. Sportswise I love skiing specially off-piste and have been going with my family since I was 3 years old.
