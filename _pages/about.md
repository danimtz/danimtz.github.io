Hello there! My name is Daniel Martinez Amigo and I'm a computer systems engineering graduate from the University of Bath. While my degree covered a wide range of subjects in both computer science and electrical engineering disciplines, my main interests are in computer graphics and rendering, parallel computing and game development.

After finishing university I took a gap year to spend time with my family and focus on personal projects. I first created a software renderer project in which I learned the basics of graphics programming from rasterizing simple lines and triangles to physically based rendering of 3D meshes. This project was made using as little external dependencies as possible coding most of it myself including for example a simple vector maths library. 

Once I was done with the software renderer, I started working on Veist Engine, a personal vulkan based game engine built with the objective of learning how low level graphics APIs and game engines function. The project currently has a "proof of concept" editor using imgui and physically based rendering with image based lighting of GLTF2.0 models. 

Most recently I worked for a year at EPAM Systems as an Unreal Engine Developer where I received professional training with the engine and adquired plentiful and valuable experience about game development. While at EPAM, I took part as a technical and design co-lead in a project using Epic's Unreal Editor for Fortnite to create educational gameplay experiences.

Currently I am working on a personal project of recreating the gameplay of Destiny 2 in Unreal Engine 5 as a learning execercise while I look for employment as an Unreal Engine developer.

Feel free to check out my <a href="{{ '/portfolio/' | relative_url }}" target="_blank">projects/portfolio</a> page for more.

Outside of graphics, gamedev and engineering I like film, tv, anime and games (I am a big Destiny fan if you couldn't tell). On my spare time I ocassionally play piano as a hobby, mainly enjoying playing covers from tv series or other music I like. Sportswise I love skiing specially off-piste and have been going with my family since I was 3 years old.
