During my time at EPAM, one of the projects I worked on was creating educational gameplay experiences for EPAMS eKids programme. The main experience we created was a map using Unreal Edito for Fortnite in which players would learn about the binary numeral system through a series of puzzles, levels and different gameplay mechanics in order to learn. The target was for players to learn the basics of binary numbers, convertion from decimal to binary and viceversa and as an extra level, binary addition and subtraction.

The level was published inside of fortnite creatve and currently be played using the following code inside of fortnite: 6891-6601-6180
