My final year project for my degree at University of Bath was an investigative project which involved studying and implementing a novel method of template matching called Best-Buddies Similarity and assess its performance for meteorological applications, more specifically cloud tracking when compared to other template matching methods.

The Best Buddies Similarity algorithm showed great performance, accuracy and robustness to noise when tracking objects, people animals etc in video. This robustness to noise...
